This code takes a DMC wave function and calculates the vibrational frequencies and intensities using the ground
state approximation outlined by McCoy et. al here (https://doi.org/10.1021/jp811352c).

This is inhereted code from a previous member of our group.  When I first started out in grad school, I found it easier
to keep this as it was, however I am going to be slowly taking elements of this code and molding into my
researchCode.  Most of the structure of this code was not written by me (DMCClusters.py, CalculateSpectrum.py, 
molecularInfo.py) however I have made serious modifications to most of the code.  

In addition, all the other *.py files are my own work within the context of this original code.  If I had to do it all
over again this code would look very different than how it does right now.
